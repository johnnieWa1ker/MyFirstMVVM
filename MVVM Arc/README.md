## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnieWa1ker/MVVM-Arc.git
cd MVVM-Arc
pod install
open MVVM-Arc.xcworkspace # or xed .
```

## 🎉 Why am I building this?
1. MVVM is one of the key design patterns a developer should be aware of. And this project is designed to train my skills in this pattern.
1. As I go deeper into the topic, I will add new constructs here and I hope that in the future this project will turn from a test site into my MVVM "cheat sheet"
1. I love to learn something new 🤓
